Install Kubernetes cluster on Ubuntu 20.04 using K3:
--------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Update the Ubuntu system

sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade && sudo systemctl reboot

Step 2: Map the host name on each node

sudo vim /etc/hosts
172.16.10.3 master
172.16.10.4 worker01
172.16.10.10 worker02

Step 3: Install Docker on Ubuntu 20.04

sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl status docker

Step 4: Set up the main k3s node
In this step, we will install and prepare the master node. This involves installing the k3s service and starting it.

curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - --docker

Run the above command to install k3s on the master node. The script will install k3s and start it automatically.
To check whether the service is successfully installed, you can use:

sudo systemctl status k3s

We need to allow the port that will be used for communication between the master node and the worker node. The ports are 443 and 6443.

sudo ufw allow 6443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp

You need to extract the token from the host, which will be used to connect the node to the host.

On the master node:

sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
Step 6: Install k3s on the secondary node and connect them to the primary node
The next step is to install k3 on the worker node. Run the following command to install k3 on the worker node:

curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://<master_IP>:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<join_token> sh -s - --docker
where master_IP Is the IP of the master node, and join_token Is the token obtained from the master. E.g:

curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://172.16.10.3:6443 K3S_TOKEN=K1078f2861628c95aa328595484e77f831adc3b58041e9ba9a8b2373926c8b034a3::server:417a7c6f46330b601954d0aaaa1d0f5b sh -s - --docker
You can verify whether the k3s-agent on the worker node is running in the following ways:

sudo systemctl status k3s-agent
To verify that our node has been successfully added to the cluster, run:

sudo kubectl get nodes
